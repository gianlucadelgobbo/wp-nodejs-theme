Hi Gianluca.

START.swf is the first file................

The first file is.... start.swf (this is level 3).
This is the start movie. All subsequent movies load on top of this.

All important buttons have had _root.click = _root.click + 1; added to the code.


The size of the movie is.... 750 wide by 615 high (very important).


Thanks,
and good luck.
